Just some notes while my computer is down 

For a Jetson cheatsheet:

To fix a 'inconsistent use of tabs and spaces' error...

1. `pip install autopep8`
2. `autopep8 -i my_script.py`

This should fix things up. 


Notes on testing openCV. 

`testing/testing_cv2.py`

This file works fine. It shows the camera feed to the display using cv2. Slight lag but 
all good. 


`testing/fast_cv2_video_saving.py` 

This file uses multithreading to save video at a faster rate than otherwise. 
However we get a segementation fault with the plain file as it currently is. 


### Other Jetsons 

- I should makea  github repo for these notes... the laptop seems to be continually fucking up 
And I Would also want to transfer these over!
